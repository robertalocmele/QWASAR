Explanation:
find .: Search in the current directory (.) and its subdirectories.
-type f: Look for files only (ignore directories).
-name "*.sh": Search for files that end with .sh.
-exec basename {} .sh \;: For each file found, execute the basename command to print the file name without the .sh extension.
{}: Represents each file found by find.
.sh: This argument tells basename to strip the .sh extension from the file name.
