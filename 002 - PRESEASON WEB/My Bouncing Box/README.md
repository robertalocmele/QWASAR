# Welcome to My Bouncing Box
***

## Task
The goal is to create a simple version of the classic Windows screensaver where a box bounces around the screen. The challenge is to get the box to move smoothly and bounce off the edges correctly. The box should also display your Qwasar login in lowercase.

## Description
I solved this by writing a bit of JavaScript that moves a div element (the box) diagonally across the screen. When the box hits the edges, it changes direction. The animation is done with a timer that updates the box’s position regularly. It's all pretty straightforward with just basic HTML and JavaScript—no fancy libraries needed.

## Installation
You don’t need to install anything. Just clone the repo and open the index.html file in your browser.

## Usage
Once you open index.html in your browser, the box with your Qwasar login will start bouncing around the screen automatically.
